## Random Scala Work

This repo contains lots of random Scala work that I am currently (2019 March) working on. I'm exploring concepts such as concurrency, file processing, recursion, etc. 

In particular, I'm working on a way to maximize network usage when transferring large files. 

Technologies used
- ScalaTest
- Java.NIO
